## Project description

[//]: # This repo contains the project that I have been working on as part of my education at NTNU. It is a train dispatch system with a text-based user menu.

## Project structure

[//]: # In this repo you will find TrainDispatchSystem folder. Inside this folder, you will find the src/ folder and a file called pom.xml. These are two crucial components of a maven project.

## Link to repository

[//]: # (https://github.com/snake727/IDATT1003-Mappe/tree/main)

## How to run the project

[//]: # Simply copy all the Java files within src/main/java/edu/ntnu/stud and src/test/java/edu/ntnu/stud and the pom.xml file to your own maven project. Once that is done, you should be able to run the files within your own IDE. It should prompt you with a menu in the terminal, where you can interact with the system.

## How to run the tests

[//]: # To run the tests, either use a terminal and type "mvn test" while in the project folder, or you could run the tests directly in your IDE by executing them inside your own project.
