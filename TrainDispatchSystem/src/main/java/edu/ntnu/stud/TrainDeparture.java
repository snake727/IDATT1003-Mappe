/**
 * This class represents a train departure.
 * The data types used in this class are:
 * LocalTime, String, int, Duration.
 * These data types fit the variables because:
 * departureTime is a LocalTime type, as its class is well suited for the program criteria.
 * line is a string as it should be one letter and one number.
 * trainNumber is an integer, as it should be a number.
 * destination is a string as it can be anything.
 * track is a String, as strings are easier to work with than integers.
 * In retrospect, I'm not sure why I didn't use an integer here.
 * delay is a Duration type, as its class is well suited for the program criteria.
 * trainNumber is an integer, this is kept simple as there is no logic required for this variable,
